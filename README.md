## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of web development, staying up-to-date with the latest tools and technologies is essential. One such innovation is Docker, a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. In this article, you'll explore how to replace traditional tools like XAMPP with Docker to create a PHP and MySQL development environment.

## Benefits of Using Docker

Before we get started, let's briefly discuss why Docker is an excellent choice for web development:

- **Isolation**: Docker containers encapsulate your application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.
- **Portability**: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to share your development environment with others.
- **Version Control**: You can version control your Docker configurations and ensure that everyone on your team has the same environment.

Now that you understand the advantages, let's proceed to set up our Docker environment.

## Setting Up the Docker Environment

To get started, create a `docker-compose.yml` file and a `Dockerfile`. These files define your Docker environment and PHP configuration. Follow the instructions in the article to set up your environment.

## Connecting PHP to MySQL

The article provides PHP code that demonstrates how to connect to MySQL, create a database, and perform various database operations. Customize the code to fit your project's requirements.

## Executing SQL Queries

The script in the article also demonstrates how to execute SQL queries, such as creating a database and inserting data. You can adapt this code to perform other database operations in your projects.

## Displaying Data with PHP

The article showcases how to retrieve data from the MySQL database and display it using PHP. This is a crucial step in any web application where data presentation is required.

## Conclusion

In this article, you've learned how to set up a Docker environment for PHP and MySQL, connect PHP to MySQL, and execute SQL queries. Docker offers flexibility, portability, and version control, making it a compelling choice for modern web development. By following these steps, you can streamline your development process and create robust web applications.

I hope this guide has been informative and helps you transition from XAMPP to Docker for your PHP and MySQL development. Embrace the power of Docker and take your web development projects to the next level.
